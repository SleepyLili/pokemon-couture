# Pokémon Couture

A work-in-progress Phoenix app for tracking clothes acquisition in Pokémon Sun & Moon.

Currently only supports female clothes, and has only been checked against a
Pokémon Moon cartridge (and a bulbapedia clothes list.)
Another check against Pokémon Sun would be useful.

Currently, you need to have an account on the site to be able to use the tracker.
I would like to make a version that supports using the tracker while not logged in as well.
## Other Clothing Masterlists - Inacuraccies
My app has adapted the following masterlists, however, when checking in the
actual Pokémon Moon game, I found several inacuraccies:

- https://samurai-gamers.com/pokemon-sun-and-moon/apparel-items-list/ is missing an entire shop.
Some pieces list wrong colors, or misattribute gender.
- https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/customisation.shtml is incomplete.
- https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fashion_item seems to be accurate.
