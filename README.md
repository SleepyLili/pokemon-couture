# Pokémon Couture

A work-in-progress Phoenix app for tracking clothes acquisition in Pokémon Sun & Moon.

Only supports female clothes for now, and has only been checked against a
Pokémon Moon cartridge (and a bulbapedia clothes list.)
Another check against Pokémon Sun would be useful.

Currently, you need to have an account on the site to be able to use the tracker.
Also, there is no e-mail server connected, so e-mails are not verified,
and password resets and e-mail changes have to be done by contacting the admin.

## Possible future improvements
While the app is currently in a state that works, there are some improvements I would like to make for it later down the line.

Some of those are:
- Support for male clothes
- Support for the few extra items from Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon
- A version of the tracker that works without an account
  - A transfer feature that allows to copy that progress upon account creation
- Working e-mail verification
- Better look for the tracker page
  - Display clothes in a more organized manner
  - Sort clothes the same way the game does it

### Other Clothing Masterlists - Inacuraccies
My app has adapted the following masterlists, however, when checking in the
actual Pokémon Moon game, I found several inacuraccies:

- https://samurai-gamers.com/pokemon-sun-and-moon/apparel-items-list/ is missing an entire shop.
Some pieces list wrong colors, or misattribute gender.
- https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/customisation.shtml is incomplete.
- https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fashion_item seems to be accurate.
